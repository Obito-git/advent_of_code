# Inputs for Advent of Code

[About the Inputs](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about#faq_copying)
**Can I copy/redistribute part of Advent of Code?** Please don't. Advent of Code is free to use, not free to copy. If you're
posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs.
If you're making a website, please don't make it look like Advent of Code or name it something similar.
